# Tongue Twisters Dataset
A dataset containing tongue twisters for ML approaches.
### About the Dataset
This dataset of about 594 tongue twisters was created on 23<sup>rd</sup> of December, 2020 by [Dweep Joshipura (me)](https://github.com/djthegr8)            
The collection of data is from Web Scraping, and this dataset is very much in development, as 594 sentences is far too less for a good training.
## Why?
Personally, I have always liked tongue twisters. They are an important part of linguistics for any language. The motive behind this is to, hopefully, train Machine Learning models that have potential to ~
* Identify
* Differenciate
* and Generate                      

tongue twisters just like humans!
